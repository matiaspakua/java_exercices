## Single Responsibility 

Each class should have only one sole purpose, and not be filled with excessive functionality

## Open Closed 

Classes should be open for extension, closed for modification. In other words, you should not have to rewrite an existing class for implementing new features.

## Liskov Substitution 

Let Φ(x) be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then Φ(y) should be true for objects y of type S where S is a subtype of T. This means that every subclass or derived class should be substitutable for their base or parent class

##Interface Segregation 

Interfaces should not force classes to implement what they can’t do. Large interfaces should be divided into small ones.

##Dependency Inversion 

Components should depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
